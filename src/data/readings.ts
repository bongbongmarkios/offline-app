    lyrics: `Leader: The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
People: He maketh me to lie down in green pastures:
Leader: He leadeth me beside the still waters.
People: He restoreth my soul:
Leader: He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
People: Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me;
Leader: Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
All: Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever. Amen.`,

    title: 'A Call to True Worship (Isaiah 1:12-17)',
    lyrics: `Leader: When you come to appear before me, who has required of you this trampling of my courts?
People: Bring no more vain offerings; incense is an abomination to me.
Leader: New moon and Sabbath and the calling of convocationsâ€” I cannot endure iniquity and solemn assembly.
People: Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates;
Leader: they have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them.
People: When you spread out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you;
Leader: even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood.
People: Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your deeds from before my eyes;
Leader: cease to do evil, learn to do good;
All: seek justice, correct oppression; bring justice to the fatherless, plead the widow's cause. Amen.`,
